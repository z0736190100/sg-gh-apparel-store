## Maven Integration

The frontend build is integrated with Maven using the frontend-maven-plugin. This allows the frontend to be built as part of the Maven build process.

To build the entire application (backend and frontend) using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

This will:
1. Clean the project
2. Install Node.js and npm
3. Install frontend dependencies
4. Build the frontend
5. Package the application with the frontend assets included

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These are defined in the following files:

- `.env` - Default environment variables
- `.env.development` - Development environment variables
- `.env.test` - Test environment variables
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the backend API using generated TypeScript clients from the OpenAPI specification. The API client is automatically generated during the build process.
